## Gradoop Quickstart

To get started with [Gradoop](http://www.gradoop.com), we will walk through the setup, and 
use some basic operators on an example graph. You can find the whole sourcecode of the quickstart 
[here](src/main/java/GradoopQuickstart.java).

See the [wiki](https://github.com/dbs-leipzig/gradoop/wiki/Getting-started) for an explanatory text.
